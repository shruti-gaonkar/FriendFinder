2. The survey has 10 questions. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. 

3. Once the app has found the current user's most compatible friend, the result is displayed as a modal pop-up. The modal displays both the name and picture of the closest match.

4. The current user's information is then added to the friend's list.
